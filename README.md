# graphql-basta-2019
Demo code of my Basta 2019 session "GraphQL mit .NET" (C#, ASP.NET Core, graphql-dotnet).

This repository contains the live coded version, that was developed during the session (project BookStore).

Also included is a basic implementation showing the usage of EntityFramework in combination with GraphQL.NET (project BookStoreEF), which was not part of the demo during the session.

Please treat the code in this repository as demo code (not production ready).
